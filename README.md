# STM32
This repository contains my STM32 assessment project developed using the NUCLEO-G070RB board. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate core embedded systems concepts through bare-metal programming, without relying on high-level abstraction layers like STM32CubeMX or HAL libraries.
